# A* Path Finding Algorithm in Python
# Overview
This project implements the A* Pathfinding Algorithm using Python and Pygame. It visualizes the process of finding the shortest path between a start and an end point on a grid, navigating around obstacles (barriers).

# Features
A Algorithm*: Efficient pathfinding using the heuristic-based A* search algorithm.
Interactive Grid: Users can click to set start, end, and barriers (obstacles).
Visualization: Step-by-step visualization of the pathfinding process with color-coded nodes (open, closed, path).
Keyboard & Mouse Control: Use the left and right mouse buttons to interact, and the spacebar to start the algorithm.

# Controls
Left Click: Set start, end, or barriers.
Right Click: Reset nodes (start, end, barriers).
Spacebar: Start pathfinding algorithm.
C: Clear the grid.
